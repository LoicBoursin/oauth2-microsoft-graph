# Microsoft Graph Provider for OAuth 2.0 Client

This package provides Microsoft Graph OAuth 2.0 support for the PHP League's [OAuth 2.0 Client](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-client).

## Requirements

The following versions of PHP are compatible:
- PHP 8.2
- PHP 8.1
- PHP 8.0

Newer versions may be compatible but have not been tested.

## Installation

To install, use composer:

```
composer require LoicBoursin/oauth2-microsoft-graph
```

## Usage

Usage is the same as The League's OAuth client, using `\LoicBoursin\OAuth2\Client\Provider\MicrosoftUser` as the provider.

#### Managing Scopes and State

When creating your Microsoft authorization URL, you can specify the state and scopes your application may authorize.

If neither are defined, the provider will utilize internal defaults.

At the time of authoring this documentation, the following scopes are available (most important ones) :

- openid
- email
- profile
- (Eventually) User.Read

#### Overriding default values

If you need to override the default values such as authorization URL or default scopes, you can do so by extending the provider through your own provider class, then overriding any of the properties or methods required, for example:

```php
<?php

use LoicBoursin\OAuth2\Client\Provider\Microsoft;

class MyCustomMicrosoftProvider extends Microsoft
{
    protected string $urlAuthorize = 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/{TenantId}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize';
    protected string $urlAccessToken = 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/{TenantId}/oauth2/v2.0/token';
}
```

Both the `$urlAuthorize` and `$urlAccessToken` URLs have been set to a specific tenant ID authentication endpoint, `{TenantId}` being a placeholder for the tenant ID required. This is often required for authentication with app registrations/applications that are specifically set for a single tenant, rather than multi-tenant. The default common endpoints, will only work for multi-tenant enabled app registrations.

## Testing

$ make test
```
